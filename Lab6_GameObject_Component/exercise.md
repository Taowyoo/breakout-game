- Exercise 1 -- list some of the components that you think are associated with some of the game objects you see in the following screenshot. You should be able to identify at least 3 individual 'components' that make up the game objects shown.
  - Remember that components are things that could be added to GameObjects, such that they can change or add behavior to that particular game object.
    -  For reference, you may look at other Game Engines like Unity3D for inspiration: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Components.html



1. Graphic component: Store and show object texture
2. Collision component: Collision detection; store object shape for collision
3. Sound component: Play sound effect
4. Gameplay component: Store gameplay info
5. Camera component: Game Camera
6. Transform/position component: Maintain position of the object
