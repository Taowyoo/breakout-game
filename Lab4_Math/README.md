# Lab

**Lab materials must be pushed to your repository one week from now before the next class begins**

**Read:** *Labs are designed to be finished in class if you work diligently, but expected to take 1-2 hours outside of class. They are often more 'tutorial' in style, and sometimes the solution may even be provided in pieces for you to type in and experiment. Copying & Pasting is discouraged however--make mistakes, play, and you will further learn the material.*

## Logistics

You will be working on your own laptop today.

Today's lab has the following part(s):

1. [Part 1](./part1) discusses some C++ concepts and how to build your project.
2. [Part 2](./part2) is about building the TinyMath.hpp library.
3. (**Optional maybe bonus**) [Part 3](./part3) is about improving your TinyMath.hpp library.
    - As mentioned, part 3 is optional and here purely for your enrichment.
    - We probably will not grade it, but it's worth having some samples.
    - We can discuss it however, and you can use it going forward.


## Deliverables

- Part 1 - Read Part 1--there is no deliverable.
- Part 2 - Two portions
  - Implement TinyMath.hpp
  - Write 12 unit tests in the tests.cpp file.
- (Optional) Part 3 - This part is optional and will not be graded. I'll talk with TA's about maybe making this bonus if you do implement and do a nice job.

You must complete this lab one week from today's class. You will run your lab in front of me at the start of the next lab when class starts and tell me what your group # was for that week.

## Rubric

You (and any partner(s)) will receive the same grade from a scale of 0-2.

- 0 for no work completed by the deadline
- 1 for some work completed, but something is not working properly
- 2 for a completed lab (with possible 'going further' options completed)
